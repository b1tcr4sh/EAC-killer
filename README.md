# EAC Killer Script for VRChat
## Two simple scripts used to start vrchat and kill the EAC process once the game is loaded.

### Installation:
Place both scripts in your VRChat game directory and run the `run-script.bat` with admin privileges to start the game.

These scripts require you to have python installed and accessible through your path in order to work.
